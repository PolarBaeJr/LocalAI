      "I'm powered by a large language model (LLM) developed by Mistral AI, running on cloud infrastructure. It can best be described as a **pretrained, transformer-based model fine-tuned for conversational tasks**. In simpler terms, it's a sophisticated AI trained on a massive amount of text data to predict and generate human-like language, tailored to be helpful, accurate, and safe for users.\n\nThink of it this way: if an AI were a car, I'm the software for the engine—designed to talk to users with helpful, accurate, and appropriate information, but I’m not a single-branded \"model\" like GPT, but my 'motor' is similar in architecture and purpose."
